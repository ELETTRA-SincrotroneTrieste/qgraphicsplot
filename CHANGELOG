release_2_7_0: fix: invisible curves are now ignored when calculating axes bounds from curves max and mins

release_2_6_0: multiple Y scales in plot have been introduced

release_2_5_1: Fixed bug in ScaleItem: space needed by labels must be scaled with current transformation 
		matrix m11 and m22 before changing the rectangle.
		Fixed MarkerItem curve name sections

release_2_5_0: LegendItem rewritten. ScaleLabelInterface: added longestLabel pure virtual method to 
               improve scale labels size calculations.

release_2_4_1: fix in PlotSceneWidget::getClosest


release_2_4_0: Added support for Qt5.
               If Qt5 qmake is used, the build library will be named liqgraphicsplot-qt5.so

	       Improved MarkerItem behaviour, dot on the line and text at the top left corner of the view.
	       MarkerItem now ignores transformations.

	       ScaleItem now does not scale contents when plot is zoomed. Ticks and label size remain constant
	       through zooming.

release_2_2_4
	* Added a new method to add a curve (accepts an already allocated SceneCurve)
	* src/curve/painters/circleitemset.h: changed private method into protected

release_2_2_3
    * Fixed include directives in dotspainter.h and dotspainter.cpp
    * curveitem.cpp: fixed return value in ItemPainterInterface *CurveItem::itemPainter().
      Now it correctly returns NULL when there are no ItemPainters installed
    * Removed QDESIGNER_WIDGET_EXPORT from plotscenewidget.h

release_2_2_2
    * Dynamic properties support in configuration dialog for all (Q)Objects.
    * Axis title, axis title font and axis title color properties have been added to the ScaleItem.
    * PlotSceneWidget::resizeEvent has been modified so that until a wheel event or a zoom event take place
      the sceneRect is adjusted to the viewport rect. This brings the behaviour of the PlotSceneWidget nearer
      to the one adopted by Qwt plots. This fixes geometry problems when the PlotSceneWidget is placed inside
      a QTabWidget.
    * Save data method added to PlotSceneWidget in order to save the data of the plot on a text file (csv).
      The dialog is the same used in QTango 4.3.4.

    * ScaleLabelInterface: introduced a new pure virtual method named type aimed at rtti information.
      - TimeScaleLabel now implements this method.


release_2_2_1
    * Some fixes in ScaleItem
    * Added shortcuts in PlotSceneWidget to set x and y axes bounds, autoscale, labels outside canvas
    * Added a property to set scene background, in order to change the plot color background.
    * "alias" SceneCurve property can be set so that the MarkerItem shows a custom text instead of a
      curve source.

release_2_2_0:
    * Completely renewed configuration dialog.
    * addLineCurve method added in PlotSceneWidget that automatically manages curve creation,
      CurveItem association and ItemPainter.
    * Curve legend added.
    * Qt designer plugins for PlotSceneWidget and ExternalScaleWidget


release_2_1_0: 

    Requires Qt >= 4.8 in order to build.
    Applications using the library will require at least Qt 4.8. This constraint guarantees a better performance.

    When zoomed, the scales and the grid become denser. 

    KNOWN ISSUES: zooming after a certain degree causes the grid not to be uniformly drawn. We are looking for 
                  a fix...

release_2_0_2:

    The  PlotSceneWidget notifies when scaled through a signal called viewScaleChanged.
    GraphicsObject conected to this signal can be accordingly scaled if desired.

    - viewScaleChanged signals were introduced in PlotSceneWidget class in order to be notified when
      the view is scaled
    - CircleItemSet : circles can be scaled through a scale divider and a SLOT called setRadiusScaleDivider
    - TargetItem: can be scaled via the TargetItem::setRadiusScaleDivider SLOT

release_2_0_1:
    - added Q_PROPERTY macros in src/horizontalscalewidget.h and src/verticalscalewidget.h
      so that the configuration dialog works for them (it considers the last meta object properties only)

    - added QDateTime/double conversion methods and properties for upper and lower bound

    - Property Dialog recognizes and manages QDateTime and QFont property types.

    - removed unused and other warnings

    - TargetItem: implemented xAxisBoundsChanged and yAxisBoundsChanged to correctly reposition the item
                  when the axes scale change.

Fixes:

    Fixes on src/axes/scaleitem.cpp:
    Introduced a method mNotifyBoundsChanged which notifies listeners when the
    axes bounds change.
    Fixed setBounds() that did not use to call updateLabelsCache() and d_ptr->view->boundsChanged

release_2_0_0:
    - improved graphics performance via QPainter clipping
    - zoom with Ctrl+Shift on the plot
    - external scale widgets have been introduced
    - Qt4 designer plugins for PlotSceneWidget and scale widgets
    - many more...

release_1_0_5: CurveItem: added a method to return the SceneCurve
               associated to the item. See curveitem.h and curveitem.cpp

release_1_0_4: TargetItem auto repositioning when plot canvas rect changes.

release_1_0_3: corrected click event on plot scene widget

release_1_0_2: axes improvements

release_1_0_1: corrections to CircleItemSet

release_1_0_0: first release.
