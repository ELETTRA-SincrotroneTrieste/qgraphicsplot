A) Install QGraphicsPlot library.

Adjust graphicsplot.pro according to your needs and environment.
In particular, consider setting the

INSTALL_ROOT

so that it points to the place where the library has to be installed
(for example /usr/local/qgraphicsplot)

In the first lines of qgraphicsplot.pro you may also choose specific directories
for library and include installations.

+---                                                               --+

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Since version 2.1.0, the library requires Qt>=4.8
This choice may impact performance.
If you want to build the library with a previous version of Qt,
remove the error line in qgraphicsplot.pro and comment out the
check for the Qt version done in src/plotscenewidget.h, after the
include directives at the top.

+---                                                                 +


+---                                                               --+
NOTE: Qt5 support
If you use qt5 qmake, the library will have a "-qt5" suffix.
All Qt libraries that need QGraphicsPlot must then be (re)compiled
against qt5 (for example, TGraphicsPlot)
+---                                                                 +


1. Build the library
- qmake
- make

2. Install the library
 - qmake
 - make install (as root, if you haven't the write permissions on the INSTALL_ROOT directory)


B) Install Qt4 designer plugins

cd src/plugins

Adjust qgraphicsplotplugin.pro (INSTALL_ROOT must be the same as before)

1. build plugins
- qmake
- make

2. install plugins
- qmake
- make install (as root, if necessary)

C) Compile examples.

cd examples
- qmake
- make

This will automatically compile all the examples provided with the distribution
of the library.

The qwt examples need the qwt libraries and are provided in order to offer a performance
comparison with the qwts (version 5)

To link your applications to the library:

-L/usr/local/qgraphicsplot/lib -lQGraphicsPlot

where /usr/local/qgraphicsplot/lib may be different according to INSTALL_ROOT and
LIB_DIR settings in qgraphicsplot.pro

Documentation is installed in SHAREDIR directory specified in qgraphicsplot.pro

Read also the README file contained in the same directory as this file.
